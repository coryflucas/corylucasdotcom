          <p>
            I am a software engineer/team lead with 8+ years of professional
            experience in developing and supporting applications to run on the
            desktop and the web. I am familiar with working with off site teams
            and with development models ranging from waterfall to agile
            programming. I have worked extensively with both Java/JEE and
            C#/.Net technology stacks, and both open source and proprietary
            frameworks. Always looking for the next technology to learn and ways
            to improve myself.
