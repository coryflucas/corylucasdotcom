      <p>
        I am a software engineer/team lead with 15+ years of professional
        experience in developing and supporting applications to run on the
        desktop and the web. I am familiar with working with off site teams
        and with development models ranging from waterfall to agile
        programming. I have worked extensively with both Java/JEE and
        C#/.Net technology stacks, and both open source and proprietary
        frameworks. I am always looking for the next technology to learn and ways
        to improve myself.
